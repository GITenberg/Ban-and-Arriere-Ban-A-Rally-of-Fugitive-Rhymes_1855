<h2>ERRATUM</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Reader</span>, a blot hath escaped the
watchfulness of the setter forth: if thou wilt thou mayst amend
it.&nbsp; The sonnet on the forty-fourth page, against all right
Italianate laws, hath but thirteen lines withal: add another to
thy liking, if thou art a Maker; or, if thou art none, even be
content with what is set before thee.&nbsp; If it be scant
measure, be sure it is choicely good.</p>

HELD THE BASS FOR KING JAMES&mdash;1691&ndash;1693</h2>
<p style="text-align: center">Time of Narrating&mdash;1743</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Ye</span> hae heard Whigs
crack o&rsquo; the Saints in the Bass, my faith, a gruesome
tale;<br />
How the Remnant paid at a tippeny rate, for a quart o&rsquo;
ha&rsquo;penny ale!<br />
But I&rsquo;ll tell ye anither tale o&rsquo; the Bass,
that&rsquo;ll hearten ye up to hear,<br />
Sae I pledge ye to Middleton first in a glass, and a health to
the Young Chevalier!</p>
<p class="poetry">The Bass stands frae North Berwick Law a league
or less to sea,<br />
About its feet the breakers beat, abune the sea-maws flee,<br />
There&rsquo;s castle stark and dungeon dark, wherein the godly
lay,<br />
<a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>That made
their rant for the Covenant through mony a weary day.<br />
For twal&rsquo; years lang the caverns rang wi&rsquo; preaching,
prayer, and psalm,<br />
Ye&rsquo;d think the winds were soughing wild, when a&rsquo; the
winds were calm,<br />
There wad they preach, each Saint to each, and glower as the
soldiers pass,<br />
And Peden wared his malison on a bonny leaguer lass,<br />
As she stood and daffed, while the warders laughed, and wha sae
blithe as she,<br />
But a wind o&rsquo; ill worked his warlock will, and flang her
out to sea.<br />
Then wha sae bright as the Saints that night, and an angel came,
say they,<br />
And sang in the cell where the Righteous dwell, but he took na a
Saint away.<br />
There yet might they be, for nane could flee, and nane
daur&rsquo;d break the jail,<br />
And still the sobbing o&rsquo; the sea might mix wi&rsquo; their
warlock wail,<br />
<a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>But then
came in black echty-echt, and bluidy echty-nine,<br />
Wi&rsquo; Cess, and Press, and Presbytery, and a&rsquo; the dule
sin&rsquo; syne,<br />
The Saints won free wi&rsquo; the power o&rsquo; the key, and
cavaliers maun pine!<br />
It was Halyburton, Middleton, and Roy and young Dunbar,<br />
That Livingstone took on Cromdale haughs, in the last fight of
the war:<br />
And they were warded in the Bass, till the time they should be
slain,<br />
Where bluidy Mitchell, and Blackader, and Earlston lang had
lain;<br />
Four lads alone, &rsquo;gainst a garrison, but Glory crowns their
names,<br />
For they brought it to pass that they took the Bass, and they
held it for King James!</p>
<p class="poetry">It isna by preaching half the night,
ye&rsquo;ll burst a dungeon door,<br />
<a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>It wasna by
dint o&rsquo; psalmody they broke the hold, they four,<br />
For lang years three that rock in the sea bade Wullie Wanbeard
gae swing,<br />
And England and Scotland fause may be, but the Bass Rock stands
for the King!</p>
<p class="poetry">There&rsquo;s but ae pass gangs up the Bass,
it&rsquo;s guarded wi&rsquo; strong gates four,<br />
And still as the soldiers went to the sea, they steikit them,
door by door,<br />
And this did they do when they helped a crew that brought their
coals on shore.<br />
Thither all had gone, save three men alone: then Middleton
gripped his man,<br />
Halyburton felled the sergeant lad, Dunbar seized the gunner,
Swan;<br />
Roy bound their hands, in hempen bands, and the Cavaliers were
free.<br />
And they trained the guns on the soldier loons that were down
wi&rsquo; the boat by the sea!<br />
<a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>Then
Middleton cried frae the high cliff-side, and his voice
garr&rsquo;d the auld rocks ring,<br />
&lsquo;Will ye stand or flee by the land or sea, for I hold the
Bass for the King?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">They had nae desire to face the fire; it was
mair than men might do,<br />
So they e&rsquo;en sailed back in the auld coal-smack, a sorry
and shame-faced crew,<br />
And they hirpled doun to Edinburgh toun, wi&rsquo; the story of
their shames,<br />
How the prisoners bold had broken hold, and kept the Bass for
King James.</p>
<p class="poetry">King James he has sent them guns and men, and
the Whigs they guard the Bass,<br />
But they never could catch the Cavaliers, who took toll of ships
that pass,<br />
They fared wild and free as the birds o&rsquo; the sea, and at
night they went on the wing,<br />
And they lifted the kye o&rsquo; Whigs far and nigh, and they
revelled and drank to the King.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>Then Wullie Wanbeard sends his ships to siege the Bass in
form,<br />
And first shall they break the fortress down, and syne the Rock
they&rsquo;ll storm.<br />
After twa days&rsquo; fight they fled in the night, and glad
eneuch to go,<br />
With their rigging rent, and their powder spent, and many a man
laid low.</p>
<p class="poetry">So for lang years three did they sweep the sea,
but a closer watch was set,<br />
Till nae food had they, but twa ounce a day o&rsquo; meal was the
maist they&rsquo;d get.<br />
And men fight but tame on an empty wame, so they sent a flag
o&rsquo; truce,<br />
And blithe were the Privy Council then, when the Whigs had heard
that news.<br />
Twa Lords they sent wi&rsquo; a strang intent to be dour on each
Cavalier,<br />
But wi&rsquo; French cakes fine, and his last drap o&rsquo; wine,
did Middleton make them cheer,<br />
<a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>On the
muzzles o&rsquo; guns he put coats and caps, and he set them
aboot the wa&rsquo;s,<br />
And the Whigs thocht then he had food and men to stand for the
Rightfu&rsquo; Cause.<br />
So he got a&rsquo; he craved, and his men were saved, and nane
might say them nay,<br />
Wi&rsquo; sword by side, and flag o&rsquo; pride, free men might
they gang their way,<br />
They might fare to France, they might bide at hame, and the
better their grace to buy,<br />
Wullie Wanbeard&rsquo;s purse maun pay the keep o&rsquo; the men
that did him defy!</p>
<p class="poetry">Men never hae gotten sic terms o&rsquo; peace
since first men went to war,<br />
As got Halyburton, and Middleton, and Roy, and the young
Dunbar.<br />
Sae I drink to ye here, <i>To the Young Chevalier</i>!&nbsp; I
hae said ye an auld man&rsquo;s say,<br />
And there may hae been mightier deeds of arms, but there never
was nane sae gay!</p>

34</span>BALLADE OF YULE</h2>
<p class="poetry"><i>This life&rsquo;s most jolly</i>, Amiens
said,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Heigh-ho, the Holly!&nbsp; So sang he.<br />
As the good Duke was comforted<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In forest exile, so may we!<br />
The years may darken as they flee,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And Christmas bring his melancholy:<br />
But round the old mahogany tree<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We drink, we sing <i>Heigh-ho</i>, <i>the
Holly</i>!</p>
<p class="poetry">Though some are dead and some are fled<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To lands of summer over sea,<br />
The holly berry keeps his red,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The merry children keep their glee;<br />
They hoard with artless secresy<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; This gift for Maude, and that for Molly,<br />
And Santa Claus he turns the key<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On Christmas Eve, <i>Heigh-ho</i>, <i>the
Holly</i>!</p>

How &lsquo;Rab and Allan cam to pree,&rsquo;<br />

<p>Jeanne d&rsquo;Arc is said to have led a Scottish force at
Lagny, when she defeated the Burgundian, Franquet
d&rsquo;Arras.&nbsp; A Scottish artist painted her banner; he was
a James Polwarth, or a Hume of Polwarth, according to a
conjecture of Mr. Hill Burton&rsquo;s.&nbsp; A monk of
Dunfermline, who continued Fordun&rsquo;s Chronicle, avers that
he was with the Maiden in her campaigns, and at her
martyrdom.&nbsp; He calls her <i>Puella a spiritu sancto
excitata</i>.&nbsp; Unluckily his manuscript breaks off in the
middle of a sentence.&nbsp; At her trial, Jeanne said that she
had only once seen her own portrait: it was in the hands of a
Scottish archer.&nbsp; The story of the white dove which passed
from her lips as they opened to her last cry of <i>Jesus</i>! was
reported at the trial for her Rehabilitation (1450&ndash;56).</p>
<h3><a name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 116</span>Page

<i>One of that Name</i>.</h3>
<p>Two archers of the name of Lang, Lain, or Laing were in the
French service about 1507.&nbsp; See the book on the Scottish
Guard, by Father Forbes Leith, S. J.</p>
<h3><i>Thy Church unto the Maid Denies</i>.</h3>
<p>These verses were written, curiously enough, the day before
the Maiden was raised to the rank of &lsquo;Venerable,&rsquo; a
step towards her canonisation, which, we trust, will not be long
delayed.&nbsp; It is not easy for any one to understand the whole
miracle of the life and death of Jeanne d&rsquo;Arc, and the
absolutely unparalleled grandeur and charm of her character,
without studying the full records of both her trials, as
collected and published by M. Quicherat, for the
Soci&eacute;t&eacute; de l&rsquo;Histoire de France.</p>

<i>How they held the Bass</i>.</h3>
<p>This story is versified from the account in <i>Memoirs of the
Rev. John Blackader</i>, by Andrew Crichton, <a

the Gospel.&nbsp; Second Edition.&nbsp; Edinburgh, 1826.&nbsp;
Dunbar was retained as a prisoner, when negotiations for
surrender, in 1691, were broken off by Middleton&rsquo;s return
with supplies.&nbsp; Halyburton was, it seems, captured later,
and only escaped hanging by virtue of the terms extorted by
Middleton.&nbsp; Patrick Walker tells the tale of Peden and the
girl.&nbsp; Wodrow, in his <i>Analecta</i>, has the story of the
Angel, or other shining spiritual presence, which is removed from
its context in the ballad.&nbsp; The sufferings from weak beer
are quoted in Mr. Blackader&rsquo;s Memoirs.&nbsp; Mitchell was
the undeniably brave Covenanter who shot at Sharp, and hit the
Bishop of the Orkneys.&nbsp; He was tortured, and, by an act of
perjury (probably unconscious) on the part of Lauderdale, was
hanged.&nbsp; The sentiments of the poem are such as an old
cavalier, surviving to 1743, might perhaps have
entertained.&nbsp; &lsquo;Wullie Wanbeard&rsquo; is a Jacobite
name for the Prince of Orange, perhaps invented only by the
post-Jacobite sentiment of the early nineteenth century.</p>

probably a survival from that festivity.</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
